This is my take on the popular game 'Snake' using Unity Engine. The objective is still the same as the classic game.

In order to be able to run this project/game, you'll need Unity version 2019.4.29f1 at least. You can download the entire project and put it in a folder then import it into unity.

Whether you're playing the game or checking out the scripts, Have fun!.
